##Qtile configuration files

Thiese are my qtile files, feel free to use anything you see here.
These configuration files are used with packages
listed in [Here!](https://github.com/fishfurbanter/dotfiles/.pkglist), and on archlinux-x86_64.
If you are using a different system they probably wont work.
